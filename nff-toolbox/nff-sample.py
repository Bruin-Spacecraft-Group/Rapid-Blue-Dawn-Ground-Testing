Last updated: 5-15-17

Sample python code for NanoLab payload on the NanoRacks Feather Frame. Program opens
up a serial connection and listens to decode any incoming feather frame packets. Default
values and ports are especially for use on a raspberry pi zero through the UART0 interface.
All code is provided as is by NanoRacks to help customers develop flight code for their 
Feather Frame payloads as quickly and easily as possible.

Note:
  - Use pip to download the pyserial library (pip install pyserial) if it's missing.
  - For pi zero, a line must be added to /etc/rc.local to run the python script on 
  startup. For example: python /home/pi/nff-sample.py &. The ending & runs the program
  in the background.
