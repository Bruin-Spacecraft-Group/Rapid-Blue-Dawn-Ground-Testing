BlueDawn_AIT_TPC_002

README

Prerequisites:
	- Arduino IDE
	- Arduino and cable connecting Arduino to computer
	- Python 3

To run the test:
	- Find out on which port the Arduino is connected to the computer. You can find this by looking under Tools > Port in the Arduino IDE.
	- Upload the FC_Functional.ino file to the Arduino. Do not open the serial monitor on the Arduino IDE!
	- Run FC_ISTM.py using python3. You can do this by running "python3 path/to/FC_Functional.py" in Terminal on a mac.
	- The test should print the current time on the Arduino.
